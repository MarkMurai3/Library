# Library
This a small project from The Odin Project. The user can input their book's title, author, number of pages and whether they have read it or not, into a table. They can toggle between the options of whether they've read the book or not, with a button. They can also delete the row if they want to. 

This project used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with attention to using JavaScript prototypes for the toggle feature. Each book gets a unique ID that is utilised to delete books from the table. 

Each table is first sent to an array called "myLibrary" and the table is created/updated based on the array's content.
